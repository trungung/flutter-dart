#### Routing and Navigator

* Routes

* Material Page Route
  * A modal route that replaces the entire screen with a platform-adaptive transition.
* Navigator
  * Creates a widget that maintains a stack-based history of child widgets. A Navigator can push and pop routes to help a user move from screen to screen

#### Themes

* Global Themes
  * ThemeData
* Adapting Themes
  * This is a parts of a theme and want to just change a few things without having to rewrite the whole thing? To extend a theme, we can use the copyWith method to extend it and pass in our custom styles.
